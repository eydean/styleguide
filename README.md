Style guides for Eydean-Originated Open-Source/In-house/Client based projects

Every major open-source/in-house/client based project has its own style guide:
a set of conventions(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([eydean/styleguide](https://github.com/eydean/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for Eydean's code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Eydean, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML
Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.
